# code2graph
Visualise software code dependencies on the level of individual front-end elements, functions, and database tables. 

The output is a JSON file containing nodes and edges of a graph. This serves as input for a graph visualisation tool. 

In the graph, the top node is 'App-root'. 
The next layers are UI elements, APIs, functions, etc. 
The end nodes are database tables or data files. 

Initial focus: React / Typescript.
More languages to follow later.
