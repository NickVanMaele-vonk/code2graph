# code2graph
Visualise software code dependencies when file-level dependencies just aren't detailed enough. 
This tool analyzes code dependencies on the level of front-end elements, functions, and database tables. 
The output is a graph starting at 'App-root' and ending with database tables that are either read or written to. 

Initial focus: React / Typescript.
