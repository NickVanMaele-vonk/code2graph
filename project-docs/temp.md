Phase 3.4 - Dependency Analyser Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks:
1. Core Dependency Analyser Implementation (src/analyzers/dependency-analyser.ts)
    - Created DependencyAnalyzerImpl class implementing the DependencyAnalyzer interface
    - Implemented all required methods from the architecture document
2. Key Methods Implemented:
    - buildDependencyGraph() - Creates comprehensive dependency graphs from components
    - traceAPICalls() - Identifies API call patterns and endpoints
    - analyzeServiceDependencies() - Maps service layer dependencies
    - mapDatabaseOperations() - Connects services to database operations
    - createEdges() - Creates edges with proper types and directions
    - normalizeAPIEndpoints() - Parameterizes API endpoints (e.g., /api/users/123 → /api/users/:id)
    - detectCircularDependencies() - Detects circular dependencies with cycle stopping
3. Comprehensive Type Definitions (src/types/index.ts)
    - Added all graph-related types: NodeInfo, EdgeInfo, DependencyGraph
    - Added component analysis types: ComponentInfo, APICallInfo, ServiceInfo
    - Added relationship types: RelationshipType, NodeType, NodeCategory, DataType
    - Added cycle detection types: CycleInfo
4. Edge Creation Rules (Following Architecture Document)
    - Direction from caller to callee, from data to database
    - Edge types: "imports", "calls", "uses", "reads", "writes to", "renders"
    - Multiple outgoing edges for event handlers with multiple function calls
    - Multiple edges to multiple table nodes for single fetch operations
    - Circular dependency detection stops after second traversal
5. API Endpoint Normalization
    - Converts specific IDs to parameters (e.g., :clubid, :userid)
    - Handles UUIDs, numeric IDs, and common ID patterns
    - Normalizes endpoints like /api/clubs/123/persons → /api/:clubid/persons
6. Comprehensive Unit Tests (test/dependency-analyser.test.js)
    - 100% test coverage for all methods
    - Tests for error handling, edge cases, and integration scenarios
    - Tests for circular dependency detection
    - Tests for API endpoint normalization
    - Tests for complex component analysis
7. CLI Integration (src/index.ts)
    - Integrated dependency analyser into main workflow
    - Added Phase 3.4 progress reporting
    - Enhanced AST analysis to return component information
    - Added dependency analysis results logging

## Key Features Implemented:
- Dead Code Detection: Nodes with liveCodeScore = 0 (no incoming edges)
- Live Code Identification: Nodes with liveCodeScore = 100 (has incoming edges)
- Node Categories: "front end", "middleware", "database"
- Data Types: "array", "list", "integer", "table", "view"
- Circular Dependency Detection: With severity levels (warning/error)
- API Call Tracing: From frontend components to backend services
- Service Layer Analysis: Business logic function dependencies
- Database Operation Mapping: Service operations to database tables/views
