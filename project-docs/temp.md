# Summary
Implemented Phase 2.1: Repository Cloning System from the code2graph project plan. 

## Completed 
Files Created/Modified:
- package.json - Added required dependencies (simple-git, fs-extra, commander) and build/test scripts
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration for the project
- src/types/index.ts - Core type definitions for repository management
- src/analyzers/repository-manager.ts - Complete RepositoryManager implementation
- src/index.ts - CLI entry point with analyze command
- test/repository-manager.test.js - Comprehensive unit tests
- src/config/global-config.json - Global configuration template
- src/config/repo-config-template.json - Repository-specific configuration template
- README.md - Updated documentation with current implementation status

## Phase 2.1 Requirements Met
Repository Cloning System (Duration: 2 days, Priority: Critical)
✅ GitHub repository cloning - Implemented with simple-git library
✅ Local directory analysis support - File scanning functionality
✅ Temporary directory management - Sandboxed environment in cloned-repos/
✅ Cleanup functionality - Automatic cleanup of temporary files
✅ Error handling for network issues - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
✅ Progress reporting for cloning - Real-time progress callbacks during cloning operations

## Additional Features Implemented
Security: Read-only access, sandboxed environment, input validation
CLI Interface: Complete command-line interface with analyze, help, and version commands
Configuration System: Global and repository-specific configuration templates
Testing: Comprehensive unit tests for all major functionality
Documentation: Updated README with usage instructions and architecture details

## Architecture Compliance
The implementation follows the architecture document specifications:
Modular Design: Separate concerns into distinct, testable modules
Error Handling: Graceful handling of malformed code and network issues
Security: Sandboxed execution and input validation
Performance: Efficient processing with proper cleanup

## Usage Commands
