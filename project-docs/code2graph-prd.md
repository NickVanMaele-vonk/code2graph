# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Code2Graph - Code Dependency Visualization Tool

### Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Author**: Nick Van Maele
- **Project**: code2graph

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Code2Graph is a command-line tool that analyzes React/TypeScript codebases to create comprehensive dependency graphs, with a primary focus on identifying dead code and visualizing the complete flow from frontend components to database operations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
AI-generated code often contains duplicate and unused components, making codebases difficult to maintain and understand. Current tools provide file-level dependency analysis but lack the granular component-level insights needed to identify dead code and understand the complete data flow through a full-stack application.

### 1.3 Solution Overview
A specialized tool that:
- Analyzes React components at the granular level of informative elements (buttons, inputs, data displays)
- Traces dependencies from frontend UI elements through API calls to backend services and database operations
- Generates structured graph data in multiple formats (JSON, GraphML, DOT)
- Identifies dead code by tracking unused components, functions, and database entities
- Provides visual representations of the complete application architecture
