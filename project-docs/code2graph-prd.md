- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Author**: Nick Van Maele
- **Project**: code2graph

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Code2Graph is a command-line tool that analyzes full stack codebases to create comprehensive dependency graphs, with a primary focus on identifying dead code and visualizing the complete flow from frontend components to database operations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
AI-generated code often contains duplicate and unused components, making the resulting full stack codebases difficult to maintain and understand. Current tools provide file-level dependency analysis but lack the granular component-level insights needed to identify dead code and understand the complete data flow through a full-stack application.

### 1.3 Solution Overview
A specialized tool that:
- Analyzes React components at the granular level of informative elements (buttons, inputs, data displays)
- Traces dependencies from frontend UI elements through API calls to backend services and database operations
- Generates structured graph data in multiple formats (JSON, GraphML, DOT)
- Identifies dead code by tracking unused components, functions, and database entities
- Provides visual representations of the complete application architecture

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Primary Features (MVP)

#### 3.1.1 Repository Analysis
- **GitHub Repository Cloning**: Clone and analyze remote repositories
- **File System Scanning**: Recursively scan for React/TypeScript files
- **Multi-format Support**: Handle .tsx, .ts, .jsx, .js files
- **Security**: ensure read-only view on repo, always use sandbox environment, and never execute repo code

#### 3.1.2 Component Analysis
- **React Component Detection**: Identify functional components, class components, and hooks
- **Informative Element Identification**: Find components that exchange internal data with users:
  - Components that display database data to users (e.g., displaying a list of club members)
  - Components that capture user input or choices (e.g., forms, dialogs with Accept/Reject buttons)
  - Note: Labels and non-interactive elements are not considered informative
- **Programmatic identification**: Analyze AST using @babel/parser to identify:
  - **Primary AST Node Types**: JSXElement, JSXExpressionContainer, CallExpression, VariableDeclarator/VariableDeclaration, ArrowFunctionExpression/FunctionDeclaration, MemberExpression
  - **Display Elements**: JSX elements with JSXExpressionContainer containing props/state data
  - **Input Elements**: JSX elements with event handlers (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)
  - **Data Sources**: CallExpression patterns for API calls
  - **State Management**: VariableDeclarator with useState patterns
  - **Node Creation Rules**: Imported components become nodes if used; data arrays/variables become nodes; functions handling data/interaction become nodes; API endpoints normalized with parameters (e.g., :clubid); database tables/views become nodes; conditionally rendered components become nodes; JSX fragments analyzed same as regular JSX
  - **Node Collapse Logic**: Multiple nodes representing same data collapse into one if they lead to same database table
  - **Naming Conventions**: Use import alias for components; use array variable name for data arrays; use function name for functions; use parameterized form for API endpoints
  - **Data Typing**: Each node has "datatype" label with values {"array", "list", "integer", "table", "view"} and "category" label with values {"front end", "middleware", "database"}
  - **What Does NOT Become a Node**: External APIs (become end nodes in path); React Context providers; UI-only elements (styling, navigation without data capture); early return components; index files (containers); unused imports
  - **Edge Creation Rules**: Direction from caller to callee, from data to database; types {"calls", "reads", "writes to"}; event handlers with multiple function calls get multiple outgoing edges; single fetch with multiple tables gets multiple edges to each table; circular dependencies stop after second traversal
- **JSX Element Parsing**: Analyze JSX structure to identify component relationships
- **Import/Export Mapping**: Track component dependencies and usage
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Identify problematic dependency cycles

#### 3.1.3 Dependency Tracing
- **Frontend-to-API Mapping**: Connect React components to API endpoint calls
- **API Route Analysis**: Identify Express.js routes and middleware (framework-agnostic approach)
- **Service Layer Analysis**: Track business logic functions between API routes and database operations (e.g., getUserById, calculateTotalPrice)
- **Database Operations Analysis**: Connect services to database operations, focusing on:
  - Tables and views only (persistent data entities)
  - SELECT, UPSERT, INSERT statements that read/update table data

#### 3.1.4 Dead Code Detection
- **Dead Code Definition**: Code defined in one location but never called anywhere else in the same repository
- **Detection Method**: Based on static code analysis within the target repo, detect nodes with no incoming edges (liveCodeScore = 0)
- **Scope**: App repository only, excluding test files in first version. Test files are files stored in ./test or have "test" or "tst" in their file name or file extension
- **Assumption**: Repository is self-contained with no external callers
- **Examples**: API endpoint `/api/:clubid/persons/` is dead code if defined but never called in the codebase
- **Scoring Method**: 100 = confirmed incoming edge, meaning that at least one other function or code fragment is calling the current node; 0 = no incoming edge based on static code analysis of repo; scores 1-99 are probability scores to be used in a future version of code2graph that takes into account calls from external code. 
- **Category**: each node has a label "category" which stores the name of the layer in which the node is active. Possible values are "front end", "middleware", "database". (This list of values can be extended when the need arises)

#### 3.1.5 Output Generation
- **JSON Format**: Primary structured output format with complete dependency graph
- **GraphML Format**: For professional graph analysis tools
- **DOT Format**: For Graphviz visualization
- **Node Structure**: Every function/informative element = node, function calls = edges
- **Edge types**: possible values for relationship: "imports" | "calls" | "uses" | "reads" | "writes to" | "renders", where "reads" and "writes to" are used only if the target node is a database table or database view
- **Dead Code Identification**: Nodes with liveCodeScore = 0 (no incoming edges)
- **Live Code Identification**: Nodes with liveCodeScore = 100 (has incoming edges)
- **Dead Code Report**: List dead codes, i.e., nodes with liveCodeScore = 0

### 3.2 Secondary Features (Future Releases)

#### 3.2.1 Advanced Analysis
