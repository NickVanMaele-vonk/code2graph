# Create summarised plan

**Problem**

**Business Requirement**

**Expected Result**

**Overall context** 
For the overall context, read the following documents:
- .\project-docs\code2graph-prd.md 
- .\project-docs\code2graph-architecture.md 
- .\project-docs\code2graph-project-plan.md 

**What you should do** 
1. Analyse the statements for the **Problem**, the **Business Requirement**, and the **Expected Result** and check against the overall context. If you find contradictions or inconsistencies, do not make assumptions but point them out and ask me for input to resolve the contradictions.
2. Present a summarised correction plan.
3. Do not change the code or database yet. 

**Rules to follow**
When creating recommendations or solutions, follow the principles listed in '.\project-docs\software_engineering_principles.md' and do not deviate from them.

## Code changes

I agree with your suggestion. 
Implement it, following all rules in '.\project-docs\code-change-rules.md'. 
Don't run terminal commands yourself - just list them, let me run them, and wait for my feedback.
